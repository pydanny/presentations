Some of the key points in the outline:

III. Design and Architecture Pitfalls
    A. Lack of modularity
       1. Monolithic code becomes hard to maintain and extend
       2. Importance of separating concerns and writing modular code
    B. Spaghetti code
       1. Convoluted control flow and deeply nested conditionals
       2. Readability and maintainability issues
    C. Premature optimization
       1. Sacrificing code clarity for performance without profiling
       2. "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" principle

IV. Testing and Debugging Woes
    A. Neglecting unit tests
       1. Short-term gain, long-term pain
       2. Benefits of test-driven development (TDD)
    B. Ineffective debugging techniques
       1. Print statement debugging vs. proper use of debuggers
       2. Importance of logging and error handling

VI. Collaboration and Version Control Mishaps
    A. Merge conflicts
       1. Frequent merging and communication to avoid conflicts
       2. Resolving merge conflicts effectively
    B. Poor code review practices
       1. Importance of code reviews for catching issues early
       2. Constructive feedback and code ownership

VII. Security and Robustness Oversights
    A. Input validation vulnerabilities
       1. Injection attacks and data sanitization
       2. Principle of least privilege
    B. Handling exceptions properly
       1. Catch specific exceptions and provide meaningful error messages
       2. Avoid catching broad exceptions like Exception

IX. Lessons for the Next Generation
    A. Cultivating a growth mindset
       1. Embracing challenges and seeing failures as learning opportunities
       2. Humility and openness to feedback
    B. Embracing continuous learning
       1. Keeping up with language updates and best practices
       2. Participating in community events and staying involved

I can provide more details and examples for each of these points to further flesh out the content of the talk.
