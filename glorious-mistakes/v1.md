# Skipped Interview

---

# 1999: Skipped Zope Corp opportunity

- Schedule an interview
- Python was some weird, unknown language
- Blacksburg, Virginia was innaccessible due to transport
- Java Enterprise appeared to be the path to success (back then unnecessary complexity was popular)

---

## What I missed

- The chance to work with Guido Van Rossum, Jim Fulton, and other really smart, nice people
- Guido! I would have gone to lunch with him
- Jim Fulton created the web pattern of routing rather than PL/PHP file extensions

---

## What I learned

- At least go to the interview
- I showed up for my 2nd interview at Kraken and look where it got me

# 2.

# False = True

---

# [fit] 2. False = True

More accurately:

```python
true = 0
false = 1
```

I had a valid usecase: Big Corp software response!

Confusing as the project grew, even with code highlighting.

Got called on it early before it caused disastrous results

--- 

## What we ended up doing

```
bigcorp_response_positive = 0
bigcorp_response_negative = 1
```

---

## What I learned:

In the face of odd results, lean hard on explicit naming schemes

# Forgot Conventions

---

# Forgot Conventions

## 2010: Django Dash

---

# Django Dash

- Online hackathon run in the early days of Django
- Famous competitors

    - Django Packages
    - Read the Docs

---

## Django Convention

Apps are plural, models are singular

---

## Django Packages

App list:

1. `package.Package` not `packages.Package`
2. `grid.Grid` not `grids.Grid`

---

## Challenge

Some of the magic code I've written for other projects didn't work with Django Packages

---

## Lesson Learned

Stick to conventions!

# Format woes

---

# Fought broken NASA RSS image feed

- 2007-era NASA RSS image feed that contained multiple entries, only largest mattered
- Didn't follow any of the RSS specs of the day
- Spent weeks trying to get Python to read it in

---

# Solution: Problem pivot

- Stop treating it like RSS
- Instead, scrape as a web page
- Checked all image sizes
- Read the latest image

---

## Lesson Learned

Sometimes the problem you are trying to solve isn't the one you think it is

# Complex is better than Simple.

## 2007: Stuck on Lambdas

---

## Stuck on Lambdas

- Couldn't understand lambdas
- Blocked, banging my head

---

# [fit] Boom!

---

# Function

```python
def adder(x, y):
    return x + y
```

# Lambda

```python
adder = lambda x, y: x + y
```

---

# [fit] OMG SO EASY!

---

# [fit] But...

Complex, single-line functions are challenging to debug

---

# Docs Pain

[.column]

```python
# Standard
def adder(x, y):
    """Adds two values together  
        x: Any
        y: Any"""
    return x + y
```

[.column]

```python
# Lambda
adder = lambda x, y: x + y
adder.__doc__ = """Adds two values together  
        x: Any
        y: Any
"""
```

---

# [fit] Decorator Pain

```python
# Standard
@lru_cache(maxsize=20)
def adder(x, y):
    return x + y

# Lambda
adder = lambda x, y: x + y
adder = lru_cache(maxsize=20)(adder)
```
