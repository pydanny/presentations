What happened


#  Java Enterprise is the path to success! 

(This was back when unnecessary complexity was considered the path to success)

What happened

# [fit] Cancelled interview!

# Cancelling an interview

At a time when Python was so new Guido (and others) spent untold hours lifting up people like me.

^ This would have been a huge career jump for me, instead of languishing for 7 years in enterprise environments.

## Lessons Learned

1. Always go to interview!
2. I showed up for my 2nd interview at Kraken and look where it got me

# 2.

# False = True

---

# [fit] 2. `False = True`

More accurately:

```python
true = False
false = True
```

Usecase: Big Corp software response!

---

false = True

# Confusing as the project grew

---

true = False

# Everything became more challenging

---

False = True

# Environment encouraged errors

## What I broke

## Eventual fix

```
class BigCorpResponse:
    bigcorp_response_positive = False
    bigcorp_response_negative = True
```

---

## What I learned:

1. Business rules are often unnecessarily complex
2. Therefore, code should remain as simple as possible

# 3.

# Forgot Conventions

---

# Forgot Conventions

## 2010: Django Dash

---

# Django Dash

- Online hackathon run in the early days of Django
- Famous competitors

    - Django Packages
    - Read the Docs

---

## Django Convention

Apps are plural, models are singular

---

## Django Packages

App list:

1. `package.Package` not `packages.Package`
2. `grid.Grid` not `grids.Grid`

---

## Challenge

Some of the magic code I've written for other projects didn't work with Django Packages

---

## Lesson Learned

Stick to conventions!

# 4.

# Format woes

---

# Fought broken NASA RSS image feed

- 2007-era NASA RSS image feed that contained multiple entries, only largest mattered
- Didn't follow any of the RSS specs of the day
- Spent weeks trying to get Python to read it in

---

# Solution: Problem pivot

- Stop treating it like RSS
- Instead, scrape as a web page
- Checked all image sizes
- Read the latest image

---

## Lesson Learned

Sometimes the problem you are trying to solve isn't the one you think it is

# [fit] Upgrade all the time!

# But wait!
