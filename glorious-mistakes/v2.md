---

# What is Zope?

![inline full](assets/zope-z-logo.png)

---

# What is Zope?

- A consulting company

---

[.build-lists: true]

# What is Zope?

- A web framework with many features
    - Invented URL routing (no more `users.pl` or `accounts.cfm`)
    - Built-in admin
    - NoSQL Database
    - Typing
    - Many more features

---

# Zope dominated Python

- Zope was synonymous with Python web
- Early PyCon US had a Zope track

---

# What happened to Zope?

Created in the era where complexity and XML was added to projects to prove their worth and sell products about the project.

---

Making things public using Zope[^3]

```xml
<browser:page name="captcha.wav"
  for="captchad.interfaces.ICaptchaContainer"
  class="captchad.browser.folder.CaptchaAudio"
  permission="zope.Public" />

<browser:page
  name="captcha.png"

---

# What happened to Zope?

Becoming effective with Zope as a coder required:

- paid instruction or employment with core contributors
- xml configuration
- A large investment of time


---

# What happened to Zope?

Frameworks using Zope added too much cleverness

- Plone
- Nuxeo

# Zope Hiring Story at NASA

## Unfortunate Zope community discourse

1. Coder: "This is really hard and the docs are incomplete"

2. Contributor 1: "Take my paid class to understand it"

3. Coder: "Can we not use XML so much?"

4. Contributor 2: "Here's more complexity and XML!"

5. Coder: "Bah! I'm going to use something else"

## The something else was...

# [fit] Django

# My Zope story

1. 2007 - Zope is kind of neat. Python and ZODB rocks.
2. 2008 - Neat, but easy things are hard and hard things impossible
3. 2009 - This Django stuff allows me to get stuff done on schedule.

---

# The community

# drifted away



---

# Lessons learned

1. Complexity as a business model is bad
2. Overcomplicating your Python project to sell training and consulting and ensure job security bites you in the end

<!-- ---

# Some footnotes about Zope

1. Zope appears to have removed some of the unnecessary complexity
1. typing.Protocol is directly inspired Zope subtypes

# 3.

# Overly clever hacks


---

# My obnoxiously clever hack

I defined my own numeric variables called `true` and `false`

```python
# business/logic.py
true = 0
false = 1
```

---

Altered truthiness from Python `True` and `False` booleans

```python
# business/logic.py
true = 0  # Not truthy
false = 1 # truthy
```


---

### Obnoxiously Clever!

```python
from business import logic, true, false

def process_result(vendorResponse):
    result = None
    for res in vendorResponse.results:
        if res.status == false:
            result = logic(res)
        if result.is_valid == True
            break
    return result
```

---

[.code-highlight: 6,8]

### My code confused everyone around (including me)

```python
from business import logic, true, false

def process_result(vendorResponse):
    result = None
    for res in vendorResponse.results:
        if res.status == false:  # no code highlighting!
            result = logic(res)
        if result.is_valid == True
            break
    return result
```

# by reversing booleans

            result = logic(res)
        if result.is_valid == True
            break
    return result
```

---

## What I learned:

1. Your Python code should be intuitive

2. Your code shouldn't require three cups of coffee to be understood

3. If it makes you think too hard, rewrite it such that a beginner can understand it

<!-- 1. Business rules are often complex
2. Code should remain as simple as possible
3. Be wary of coding culture that encourages complexity -->

# Cleverness of the era

---

## Mistake: Database configuring installed apps

```sql
select app_path from apps where app_id = environ['APP_ID'];
```

```python
# Dynamically loaded INSTALL_APPS
INSTALLED_APPS += [x['app_path'] for x in records]
```

---

# Mistake: Removing None 

For languages without garbage collection, Tony Hoare said null pointer exceptions are a billion dollar mistake.

People added a clever class in a garbage collected language (Python) to replace it!

```python
class NoneError(Exception):
    # 50 lines of code I won't publish went here
```

Hint: This isn't helping

---

### Mistake: Metaclasses instead of object inheritance

Unless you are writing a framework you probably will never use metaclasses.

---

### Mistake: Cache-powered concrete models

- Caching to handle data duplication
- But cache invalidation is hard

[.build-lists: true]

## Types can add significantly to cognitive load

- Simple types can make things easier

- But it's the edge cases that hurt

- Django is an edge case for Python types 

---

# For control of behaviors they are bliss

- FastAPI
- pydantic

---

# Types are decent at catching bugs

---

# [fit] But

---

Saying:

# [fit] "Types mean we can

# [fit] avoid writing so many tests"

---

Is the same as:


# [fit] "The ORM means our 

# [fit] security is perfect" [^4]

### I love protocols but admit for some this might be 'clever'

[.column]

```python
class Child(Protocol):
      name: str

      def play(self, game): ...

class Uma:
      name: int = 5

      def play(self, game):
        # Playtime goes here    

def playground(child: Child) -> None: ...
```

[.column]

```python
playground(Uma())  

# error: Argument 1 to "playground" has 
# incompatible type "Uma"; expected "Child"
    # note:  Following member(s) of "Uma" have conflicts:
    # note:      name: expected "str", got "int"
```

---

### `Zope.interface` preceded `typing.Protocol`

Zope had similar features as modern typing. 
Zope had one of the first widely used approaches to structural subtyping in Python[^6]

[.column]

```python
from zope.interface import Interface, Attribute

class IChild(Interface):

    name = Attribute("Name of person")

    def play(game):
        """Do some play"""
```

[.column]

```python
from zope.interface import implementer

@implementer(IChild)
class Child:

    name = 'Uma'

    def play(self, game):
        return work.start()
```
