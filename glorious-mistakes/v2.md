# 3.

# Overly clever hacks


---

# My obnoxiously clever hack

I defined my own numeric variables called `true` and `false`

```python
# business/logic.py
true = 0
false = 1
```

---

Almost-but-not the breaks Python true/false contract

```python
true = 0                # falsy
false = 1               # truthy

True, [1], "Hi", {1: 2} # truthy
False, [], ""  , {}     # falsy
```


---

### Obnoxiously Clever!

```python
from business import logic, true, false

def process_result(vendorResponse):
    result = None
    for res in vendorResponse.results:
        if res.status == false:
            result = logic(res)
        if result.is_valid == True
            break
    return result
```

### My code confused everyone around (including me)

```python
from business import logic, true, false

def process_result(vendorResponse):
    result = None
    for res in vendorResponse.results:
        if res.status == false:  # Truthy value
            result = logic(res)
        if result.is_valid == True # Truthy value
            break
    return result
```

## A better approach

```

## This mistake...

```python
from business import logic, true, false

def process_result(vendorResponse):
    result = None
    for res in vendorResponse.results:
        if res.status == false: # WTF was I doing?
            result = logic(res)
        if result.is_valid == True
            break
    return result
```

---

## Becomes a better approach

```python
from business import logic, VendorStatus

def process_result(vendorResponse):
    result = None
    for res in vendor_response.results:
        if res.status == VendorStatus.NEGATIVE:
            result = logic(res)
        if result.is_valid == True
            break
    return result
```

---

## A better approach

[.code-highlight: 6,8]

```python
from business import logic, VendorStatus

def process_result(vendorResponse):
    result = None
    for res in vendor_response.results:
        if res.status == VendorStatus.NEGATIVE:
            result = logic(res)
        if result.is_valid == True
            break
    return result
```

---

[.build-lists: true]

## What I learned:

1. Python code should be intuitive

2. Code shouldn't require three cups of coffee to be understood

3. Clever architecture is better when the editor flags it
    - Code highlighting
    - ALLCAPS

<!-- 3. Code that is too hard, rewrite it such that a beginner can understand it -->

<!-- 1. Business rules are often complex
2. Code should remain as simple as possible
3. Be wary of coding culture that encourages complexity -->

## Mistake: Database configuring installed apps

--  SQL to fetch which app to load

# Mistake: Removing None 

> Null pointer exceptions are a billion dollar mistake.

-- Tony Hoare

---

# Mistake: Removing None 

(I'm not going to argue with the inventor of Null Pointers)

---

# Mistake: Removing None 

However, replacing None in Python is questionable

```python
class NullPointerHandler:
    # 50+ lines of code goes here
```

---

# Mistake: Removing None 

`NullPointerHandler` decorates/wraps:

- Every Python stdlib that could return None

---

# Mistake: Removing None 

- OMG `NullPointerHandler` touches everything!
