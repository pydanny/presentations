### I'm stupid

## Can't figure things out

# Always look for libraries first

## Can't figure things out

# OMG argparse

```python
import argparse

# sub-command functions
def foo(args):
    print(args.x * args.y)

def bar(args):
    print('((%s))' % args.z)

# create the top-level parser

parser_foo.add_argument('-x', type=int, default=1)
parser_foo.add_argument('y', type=float)
parser_foo.set_defaults(func=foo)

# create the parser for the "bar" command

# Docstrings are awesome

[.background-color: #00FF00]

## Can't remember things

# Typehints are awesome too, use them to reduce docstrings

---

# Remember this?

## Typehints means we don't have to write so many docs

```python
import typer

app = typer.Typer()


@app.command()
def foo(y: float, x: int = 1 ):

### Can't remember things

## When following a talk or tutorial,

# Write down even the slide bullets!

# For most people writing down notes enhances learning

# [fit] I'm lazy

---

# I'm lazy

- Don't wanna do anything twice
- Don't wanna debug code when I had it working before
- Don't wanna look hard for docs

---

# [fit] Here we go on laziness!

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# If I write the same code twice I stick in a function

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# I use typehints so I write less docs

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# I stick the function into a `utils` module

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# I put the function on GitHub so I don't lose it

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# Isn't this the foundation of open source?

---

[.build-lists: true]

## I'm lazy

# Don't wanna debug code that worked before

- Manually testing code by watching it run is hard
- ...and boring
- ...and hence is error prone
- ...meaning you have to do more work

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna debug code when I had it working before

# Write down how to test lest you forget

![inline](assets/running-tests.png)

---

## I'm lazy

# Don't wanna look hard for docs

Every project should have a README that covers:

- Installation
- Running the code
- Testing the code

---

## I'm lazy

# Don't wanna look hard for docs

Longer form docs should use:

- readthedocs.io
- GitHub pages
- Whatever

# [fit] Challenge of Open Source and Open Knowledge Share

- We share so everyone can benefit
- Unfortunately "everyone" includes causes we do not like

---

# [fit] IMO this is an Unfixable Problem

- Knowledge is like the current state of firearms in the USA
- Distribution is too easy
- TODO this might distract from the talk

---

# [fit] Instead, focus on ethical causes

- We cannot change society easily
- Another approach is to use our skills for the direct good
- My choice is climate change

---

# [fit] What's your choice?

- Better medical care
- Use OpenCV to do analytics on crops, not people
- Build the future we want, not what dudebros/dudesisters are trying to exit on
- TODO come up with a bunch more
