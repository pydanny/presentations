# I'm stupid

- Can't figure things out
- Can't remember things
- Too stupid not to ask stupid questions

# [fit] Let's go over each item

---

### I'm stupid

## Can't figure things out

---

[.background-color: #00FFFF]

### I'm stupid

## Can't figure things out

# Always look for libraries first

---

## Can't figure things out

# OMG argparse

```python
import argparse

# sub-command functions
def foo(args):
    print(args.x * args.y)

def bar(args):
    print('((%s))' % args.z)

# create the top-level parser
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()

# create the parser for the "foo" command
parser_foo = subparsers.add_parser('foo')
parser_foo.add_argument('-x', type=int, default=1)
parser_foo.add_argument('y', type=float)
parser_foo.set_defaults(func=foo)

# create the parser for the "bar" command
parser_bar = subparsers.add_parser('bar')
parser_bar.add_argument('z')
parser_bar.set_defaults(func=bar)

parser.parse_args()
```

## Can't figure things out

# Yay Typer!

```python
import typer

app = typer.Typer()


@app.command()

    print(x * y)

@app.command()
def bar(z: str):

# There are no stupid questions

[.background-color: #00FFFF]

## _hint:_

# The only bad question is the one you do not ask

# Don't try to impress people by not asking questions

# Obey the Thirty Minute Rule

## Don't waste more than 30 minutes on a problem without asking questions

## I'm stupid

# Can't remember things

---

[.background-color: #00FFFF]

## Can't remember things

# Docstrings are awesome

---

[.background-color: #00FF00]

## Can't remember things

# Typehints are awesome too, use them to reduce docstrings

---

# Remember this?

## Typehints means we don't have to write so many docs

```python
import typer

app = typer.Typer()


@app.command()
def foo(y: float, x: int = 1 ):
    print(x * y)

@app.command()
def bar(z: str):
    print(f'(({z}))')


if __name__ == '__main__':

# Use markdown because

# of ease and portability

---

# Markdown is so awesome it has a logo!

### Can't remember things

## When following a talk or tutorial,

# Write down even the slide bullets!

# For most people writing down notes enhances learning

# [fit] I'm lazy

---

# I'm lazy

- Don't wanna do anything twice
- Don't wanna debug code when I had it working before
- Don't wanna look hard for docs

---

# [fit] Here we go on laziness!

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# If I write the same code twice I stick in a function

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# I use typehints so I write less docs

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# I stick the function into a `utils` module

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# I put the function on GitHub so I don't lose it

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# I put the project on PyPI so I can install it easily

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# Isn't this the foundation of open source?

---

[.build-lists: true]

## I'm lazy

# Don't wanna debug code that worked before

- Manually testing code by watching it run is hard
- ...and boring
- ...and hence is error prone
- ...meaning you have to do more work

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna debug code when I had it working before

# Write down how to test lest you forget

![inline](assets/running-tests.png)

---

## I'm lazy

# Don't wanna look hard for docs

Every project should have a README that covers:

- Installation
- Running the code
- Testing the code

---

## I'm lazy

# Don't wanna look hard for docs

Longer form docs should use:

- readthedocs.io
- GitHub pages
- Whatever

# [fit] Our Work used for evil

- OpenCV (and other tools) used to spy on citizens

# Questions I Have For CA developers

# [fit] Questions to ask every employer/client

<br>

# [fit] Who is helped?

<br>

# [fit] Who is hurt?

# [fit] In other words

- Does this make the obscenely rich get richer?
- Does this subvert election processes?
- Does this intrude on individual sovreignty?
- Does this reinforce the fossil fuel industry?
- Does this hurt our future?

---

# [fit] Does this hurt our future?

Climate change is real

- A series of incrementally hotter years
- In 2022 Europe and South Asia suffered a devastating heat wave
- The South Western USA is under severe water restrictions
