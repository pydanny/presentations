# Scaling from One to Billions

---

This talk ties the core components of what makes a good Django/Python/whatever developer into activities that can affect billions of people. The volume of lives affected raises ethical questions, for as Ian Malcolm said, “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.”

This talk has this this rough schedule:

1. How I somehow got hired by NASA by saying an insanity statement during in an interview
2. Skills that emerged thanks to that insane statement
3. Sharing my code and those skills thanks to open source and community and the resources I wrote or ghost wrote
4. Seeing my work and others used for evil
5. Deciding to use my skills for good
6. How everyone in this room can use their skills for good
