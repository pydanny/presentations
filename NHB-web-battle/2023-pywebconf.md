# [fit] No Holds Barred

# [fit] Web Framework Battle

# [fit] Hello Python Web Conf!

![inline](https://2023.pythonwebconf.com/python-web-conference-2023/@@images/logo_image)

---

# What frameworks I'm covering

- Django
- FastAPI
- Flask/Quart

What I like to call "the big three"

---

# [fit] But first...

---

# What frameworks I'm not covering

- Tornado
- Pyramid
- Framework X

---

# Why not Tornado?

- Async from before asyncio
- Backbone of Jupyter projects

## But...

- Very limited usage compared to the "big three"

---

# Why not Pyramid?

- More explicit than Flask
- Some interesting ideas

## But...

- Very limited usage compared to the "big three"

---

# Why not Framework X?

- "It's my favorite framework!!!!"

## But...

- Very limited usage compared to the "big three"

---

# [fit] Back to the Big Three...

---

# The Big Three

- Django
- FastAPI
- Flask/Quart

---

# [fit] My bias

---

# [fit] Is not what you expect

---

# [fit] Yes, I've written a lot about Django

---

# [fit] I've used all three frameworks

---

# [fit] I know enough about Django to know what I don't like about it

---

# Points of comparison

- Ease of use
- Performance
- Security
- Community
- Documentation
- Ecosystem
- Features
- Code quality
- Developer experience
- Async support
