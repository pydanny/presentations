# [fit] **"What's your biggest weakness?"**

## - NASA Interviewer

---

<br><br>

# **"My biggest weakness is that I'm emotionally tied to my work so if I'm not doing well I take it personally. Then I work longer and harder to improve."**

## - My normal response

---

# This time:

<br>

# [fit] "I'm stupid and lazy"

---

# NASA Interviewer

<br>

# [fit] "WTF?!"

---

# NASA Interviewer

<br>

# [fit] "You going to explain that?"

---

# [fit] I'm stupid

---

# I'm stupid

- Can't figure things out
- Can't remember things
- Too stupid not to ask stupid questions

---

# [fit] Let's go over each item in this list

---

### I'm stupid

## Can't figure things out

# Always look for libraries first

---

## Can't figure things out

# OMG argparse

```python
import argparse

# sub-command functions
def foo(args):
    print(args.x * args.y)

def bar(args):
    print('((%s))' % args.z)

# create the top-level parser
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()

# create the parser for the "foo" command
parser_foo = subparsers.add_parser('foo')
parser_foo.add_argument('-x', type=int, default=1)
parser_foo.add_argument('y', type=float)
parser_foo.set_defaults(func=foo)

# create the parser for the "bar" command
parser_bar = subparsers.add_parser('bar')
parser_bar.add_argument('z')
parser_bar.set_defaults(func=bar)

parser.parse_args()
```

---

## Can't figure things out

# Yay Typer!

```python
import typer

app = typer.Typer()


@app.command()
def foo(y: float, x: int = 1 ):
    print(x * y)

@app.command()
def bar(z: str):
    print(f'(({z}))')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app()
```

### I'm stupid

## Too stupid not to ask stupid questions

---

# There are no stupid questions

---

# The only bad question is the one you do not ask

---

# Don't try to impress people by not asking questions

---

## No one cares

## No one remembers

---

## Too stupid not to ask stupid questions

# Obey the Thirty Minute Rule

# [fit] [daniel.feldroy.com/30](https://daniel.feldroy.com/30-minute-rule)

![inline](assets/young-me.jpg)

---

# Obey the Thirty Minute Rule

## Don't waste more than 30 minutes on a problem without asking questions

---

# Obey the Thirty Minute Rule

## Change to 60 minutes if you like

---

# Hint: Don't be a jerk and not let other people ask questions

## I'm stupid

# Can't remember things

---

## Can't remember things

# Docstrings are awesome

---

## Can't remember things

# Typehints are awesome too, use them to reduce docstrings

---

# Remember this?

## Typehints means we don't have to write so many docs

```python
import typer

app = typer.Typer()


@app.command()
def foo(y: float, x: int = 1 ):
    print(x * y)

@app.command()
def bar(z: str):
    print(f'(({z}))')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app()
```

---

## Can't remember things

# Use markdown because

# of ease and portability

---

## Use markdown because of ease/portability

# Even when I wrote in RST I had to look stuff up

---

## Use markdown because of ease/portability

# Markdown is easy to learn

---

## Use markdown because of ease/portability

# Reduce friction in your docs!

---

### Can't remember things

## When following a talk or tutorial,

# Write down even the slide bullets!

---

# For some people writing down notes enhances learning

---

## I'm stupid

# Can't remember things

### I'm stupid

## Can't remember things

# Documentation makes me look good!

---

## Documentation makes me look good!

# I can pull out old tech details that others don't have

---

## Documentation makes me look good!

# Can be used later on other projects

---

## Documentation makes me look good!

# Great for book content

# Documentation can you look good too:

# [fit] I'm lazy

---

# I'm lazy

- Don't wanna do anything twice
- Don't wanna debug code when I had it working before
- Don't wanna look hard for docs

---

# [fit] Here we go on laziness!

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# If I write the same code twice I stick in a function

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# I use typehints so I write less docs

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# I stick the function into a `utils` module

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# I put the function on GitHub so I don't lose it

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

# Isn't this the foundation of open source?

---

[.build-lists: true]

## I'm lazy

# Don't wanna debug code that worked before

- Manually testing code by watching it run is hard
- ...and boring
- ...and hence is error prone
- ...meaning you have to do more work

---

### I'm lazy

## Don't wanna debug code when I had it working before

# Write down how to test lest you forget

![inline](assets/running-tests.png)

---

## I'm lazy

# Don't wanna look hard for docs

- Every project should have a README
- Longer form docs should use:
  - readthedocs.io
  - GitHub pages
  - Whatever

---

# [fit] Did I get the job at NASA?

---

# [fit] Yes

---

# [fit] In hindsight I was lucky

---

# [fit] Thank you
