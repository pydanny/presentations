# Way Back in Late 2004...

## Recruiter scheduled me to interview for NASA work

---

# No way I was going to work for NASA

- No CS Degree
- Only 7 years of experience

---

# Treated interview as a practice session

Plan:

- Try different approaches to answers
- Have fun!

---

# How it went

- Wore a suit because why not
- Totally relaxed
- Nailed every tech question

---

# Then came the question from NASA contract interviewer:

<br>

# [fit] "What's your biggest weakness?"

---

# My normal response:

<br>

# "My biggest weakness is that I'm emotionally attached to my work so when I get stuck I take it personally"

---

# My response this time:

<br>

# [fit] "I'm stupid and lazy"

---

# NASA

<br>

# [fit] "WTF?!"
