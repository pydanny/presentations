# Way Back in Late 2004...

## Recruiter scheduled me to interview for NASA

---

# No way I was going to work for NASA

- No CS Degree
- Only 7 years of experience

---

# Treated interview as a practice session

My plan:

- Try different approaches to answers
- Have fun!

---

# How it went

- Wore a suit because why not
- Totally relaxed
- Nailed every tech question

---

# Critical question from NASA interviewer:

<br>

# [fit] "What's your biggest weakness?"

---

# How I normally responded:

<br>

# "My biggest weakness is that I'm emotionally attached to my work so when I get stuck I take it personally"

---

# This time:

<br>

# [fit] "I'm stupid and lazy"

---

# NASA

<br>

# [fit] "WTF?!"

---

# [fit] I'm stupid

---

# I'm stupid

- Can't figure things out
- Can't remember things
- Too stupid not to ask stupid questions

---

# I'm stupid

## Can't figure things out

- Always look first on PyPI or GitHub for libraries to do the work
- Ask in Discord, Slack, Twitter, Facebook, etc for answers
- Stack Overflow too

---

# I'm stupid

## Can't figure things out

- TODO Show Arg Parse way

- TODO Show typer method

---

# I'm stupid

## Too stupid not to ask stupid questions

- There are no stupid questions
- Don't try to impress people by not asking questions
- Thirty Minute Rule: [daniel.feldroy.com/30-minute-rule](https://daniel.feldroy.com/30-minute-rule)
  - Don't waste more than 30 minutes on a problem without asking questions
  - Change to 60 minutes if you like

Hint: Don't be a jerk and not let other people ask questions

---

# I'm stupid

## Can't remember things

- Docstrings are awesome
- Typehints are awesome too, use them to reduce docstrings
- Use markdown because of ease/portability
- Write down even the slide bullets

# I'm stupid

## Can't remember things

# I'm stupid

## Can't remember things

Documentation makes me look good!

- Writing stuff down helps me remember
- Can be used later for things like writing books

TODO add Two Scoops of Django image

# I'm stupid

## Can't remember things

Documentation can you look good too:

# [fit] I'm lazy

---

# I'm lazy

- Don't wanna do anything twice
- Don't wanna debug code when I had it working before
- Don't wanna look hard for docs

---

# I'm lazy

## Don't wanna do anything twice

- If I write the same code twice I stick in a function
- I use typehints so I don't have to write so much docs
- Then I stick the function into a `utils` module
- Then I put it on GitHub so I don't lose it
- Isn't this the foundation of open source?

# I'm lazy

## Don't wanna debug code when I had it working before

- Manually testing code by watching it run is hard
- ...and boring
- ...and hence is error prone
- ...meaning you have to do more work

---

# I'm lazy

## Don't wanna debug code when I had it working before

### Write down how to test in case you forget

# I'm lazy

## Don't wanna look hard for docs

- Every project should have a README
- Longer form docs should use:

  - Whatever
